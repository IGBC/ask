# ask
##### simple utility to ask the user a question during a shell script
## Usage:
### Options:
 `-o x` add answer `x` to the question (max 1 char)
 
 `-m str` set message to `str`
 
 `-d x` set default answer to `x`
## Building:
Use the test.sh file to build the application with gcc. 
If you wish to contribute a Makefile please do so, but I personally don't see a point for a single code file.
